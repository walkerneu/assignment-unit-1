<ul>I can play songs on my nose</ul>
<ul>My Dad wanted to name me Thunderclap, because there was a one-hit wonder alt-rock band from the 70's called Thunderclap Newman that he really liked, so my name would have been Thunderclap Neudorff, and effectively a pun on a pretty obscure band from the 70's. I think about it a lot</ul>
<ul>While I was a cellist in the orchestra, my high school won a Grammy for "Outstanding High School Music Program", so sometimes I say I'm a Grammy award-winning cellist</ul>

    <p>"Nobody das blame this man. You don't understand, Willie was a salesman, and to a salesman there's no rock bottom to the life. He don't put a nut to a bolt, or give you medicine, or give you the law. He's a man living way out there, on nothing but a smile and a shoeshine. When they stop smiling back, that's an earthquake. You get a couple spots on your hat, and you're finished. Nobody das blame this man. A salesman's got to dream, boy. It comes with the territory." - Funeral monologue from Death of a Salesman, play by Arthur Miller 1949</p>
